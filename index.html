        <span> performance proposal </span><br />
        <b>"Error: Funny?"</b> is a computational comedy performance, aiming to
        interrogate the ambiguity and off-limit creativity of artificial
        intelligence transforming and simulating the utter intricacy of human
        humor, through fabricating and delivering a stand-up comedy performance
        procedurally. Can machines be funny if they do not make sense to us? Is
        the attempt of computers trying to produce humor a spectacle of
        absurdity itself? <br /><br />The estimated time of the performance is
        10 mins. The entire performance will be a live-generated, gamified
        storytelling comedy, delivered by a robotic interface and a human
        performer. The two will take turns telling a story. A story conductor
        that instructs which agent speaks could be a potential addition to the
        performance. The comedy bot will use the vocabularies and the speech
        style of one or more chosen stand-up comedians that it has been trained
        on. An alternative performance will be human actors performing the
        comedy robot's generated scripts. These actors will speak and deliver
        their materials based on a conductor’s signal.<br /><br />
        The source content will not only reflect issues and themes from the
        learning source, mainstream stand-up comedians’ transcripts, but also
        expose the perplexity of a robotic generative performance itself.
        Through deconstructing comic language down to algorithmic data, the
        program generates a reconfiguration of condensed identities of the
        American comedy landscape. The overarching concept aims to invite
        audiences to observe comedy through the lens of machine-human
        interaction, further provoking new thinking around our opinions towards
        what we truly consider humorous by watching a digital agent failing to
        be funny.

        <br />This performance is part of an MFA thesis investigation in
        "Computational Comedy" by Lan Zhang at the Design and Technology program
        at Parsons School of Design. Computational Comedy stands for generating
        comedy content using procedural methodology.
