        <span> performance proposal </span><br />
        <b>"Error: Funny?"</b> is a computational comedy performance, aiming to
        interrogate the ambiguity and inability of artificial intelligence
        simulating the utter intricacy of human mind-humor-through fabricating
        and delivering a stand-up comedy set procedurally. Can machines be funny
        if they do not make common sense? Is the attempt of computers trying to
        produce humor a ridiculous act itself? <br />
        <br />
        The estimated time of the performance is 10 mins. The entire performance
        will be a generative stand-up comedy set and delivered by a robotic
        interface and a human performer. The bot will possess vocabularies and
        the speech style of one or more chosen stand-up comedians. The set
        material will be generated live on the spot. An alternative deliverable
        will be human actors performing the comedy robot's generated scripts.
        These actors will speak and deliver their materials based on a
        conductor’s signal. The topic of the script will be developed within a
        structured comedy writing framework. The source content will not only
        reflect common issues from the learning source–mainstream stand-up
        comedians but also pokes fun at the ambiguity of a stand-up robotic
        comedy performance itself. The technologies behind the scene include
        Markov chain, gpt-2, and other Machine learning text generation tools.
        The overarching concept aims to invite audiences to observe the
        condensed identities of the American comedy landscape through the lens
        of a performative machine, further provoking new thinking around our
        opinions towards what we truly consider humorous by watching a digital
        agent failing to be funny.

        <br />
        <br />This performance is part of an MFA thesis investigation in
        "Computational Comedy" by Lan Zhang at the Design and Technology program
        at Parsons School of Design. Computational Comedy stands for generating
        comedy content using procedural methodology.
