        <b>"Error: Funny?"</b> is a computational comedy performance, aiming to
        interrogate the ambiguity and inability of artificial intelligence
        simulating the utter intricacy of human mind-humor-through fabricating
        and delivering a stand-up comedy set procedurally. Can machines be funny
        if they do not make common sense? Is the attempt of computers trying to
        produce humor a ridiculous act itself? <br />
        <br />
        The estimated time of the performance is 5 mins. The entire performance
        will be a scripted stand-up comedy set, pre-generated, and delivered by
        a robotic interface. An alternative deliverable will be a human actor
        performing the comedy robot's script. The topic of the script will be
        developed within a structured comedy writing framework. The source
        content will not only reflect common issues from the learning
        sourceâ€“mainstream stand-up comedians but also pokes fun at the ambiguity
        of a stand-up robotic comedy performance itself. The technologies behind
        the scene include Machine learning and Natural language processing
        methods such as gpt-2, Markov chain, and other text generation tools.
        <br />
        <br />This performance is part of an MFA thesis investigation in
        "Computational Comedy" by Lan Zhang at the Design and Technology program
        at Parsons School of Design. The overarching concept aims to invite
        audiences to observe the condensed identities of the American comedy
        landscape through the lens of a performative machine, further provoking
        new thinking around our opinions towards what we truly consider humorous
        by watching a digital agent failing to be funny.
