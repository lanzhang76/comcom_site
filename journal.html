          My thesis around Computational Comedy tries to explore the
          possibilities of machine mirroring human’s capabilities of producing
          American humor and to investigate the emergence of advancing natural
          language processing technologies. Computational Comedy stands for
          using procedural and computational methods to generate comedy
          content.The final manifestation of “computational comedy” will be one
          or multiple comedy bot agents participating in a computer-human
          interactive performance. The bot agents are trained with different
          stand-up comedian styles and fed with culturally relevant context.
          These agents are based on an open-API’s language model called gpt-2.
          They take text inputs and produce sentences that are highly reflective
          of their learning source. The topic aims to invite audiences to
          observe the condensed themes and identities of the american comedy
          landscape through interacting with the agents, further provoking new
          thinking around our opinions towards what we truly consider humorous
          by watching machines fail to be funny.

          Humor is seen in most of my work. Sometimes it comes out bright and
          sometimes it walks on the dark side. I use humor subconsciously as if
          it is my voice of delivering difficult messages and my strategic means
          of connecting with my audiences. I’m fascinated by it after I
          discovered that thread, and now I want to dive in and figure out what
          really humor does and means to me on a personal level. People have
          written books and theories about breaking down the humor code. Yet,
          dissecting humor is still one of the most complicated machine riddles.
          There are many factors that go into the complexity such as nuances,
          cultural relevancy, language gaps, and joke deliverers’ charisma,
          their personalities, and so much more. These are already difficult for
          humans to comprehend, not to mention machines. However, we are also at
          the most promising stage where powerful learning models and
          computational methods are available for taking up bigger challenges.
          Developing an interest with working with language and words, these
          opportunities incite excitement that I cannot brush aside. Ultimately,
          to me personally, humor comprehension is a social experience. Not
          understanding jokes or failing to be funny can result in social
          exclusions. We are often time at the intersection of “you either
          understand then you are in the circle” or “you don’t get the joke so
          you are out” situations. These “In-or-Out” situations represent the
          cultural experience in American society, especially for those that
          don’t speak English as their native language as well as ones that
          aren’t culturally informed. I’ve been on this learning curve where I
          was constantly at these social crossroads. Overall, I am compelled to
          explore one’s understanding towards humor through the lens of
          computation and machines.<br /><br />
          Throughout the semester of my second year MFA thesis at Parsons school
          of design, I’ve explored this area of interest through a lot of
          small-scaled experiments, which helped me gain many insights that lead
          to my ideation of my thesis form. I started with reading many humor
          theories, psychology analysis about how we understand humor and jokes
          as a social behavior. Then I started using Markov Chain for generative
          comedy text. I tried to recreate Aziz’ Ansari’s comedy texts well as
          to recompose my writer friend’s different styles of writing samples.
          At one point, I understood I cannot just shy away from addressing the
          elephant in the room-performative aspect of comedy. So I pushed myself
          by participating in my first Improv class ever, just to get a better
          grip of the subject. It turned out to be an eye-opening experience for
          me and I continued to do a couple of more performing-related exercised
          such as performing at the Culture Hub and Babycastles Wordhack with
          Todd Anderson’s internet extension where I improved browsing and
          doodling comic experience on Craigslist. While learning more improv
          techniques and essence of the realm of studies, I started to have a
          better grasp of what entails in such a playful practice. I made an
          improv card game that pokes fun at the advertising industry, using a
          procedural method and generative elements. Moreover, on a daily basis,
          I watch a lot of comedy shows but in an analytic way. I’d apply humor
          theories I learned to every scene I see and reflect on every laughter
          had(and will never be able to undo watching them analytically). I’ve
          also read many interesting books and will continue to read these books
          that have inspired me along the way(reading notes can be found in my
          process papers). <br /><br />The final manifestation of “computational
          comedy” will take the form of a “conducted story” improv interaction
          among generative comedy-agents and human participants. The agents are
          generative bots that are trained on an open AI gpt-2 model with input
          representing different comedian styles and various context
          information. After rounds of machine learning and fine-tuning, agents
          will analyze text-input and compose contextualized sentences or
          paragraphs that highly reflect their learning sources–mainstream
          stand-up comedians’ transcripts, news, and joke rulebooks. A
          traditional conducted story is considered a basic warm-up exercise for
          improv comedy learners who collectively tell a continuous story
          without breaking the flow. However, only one storyteller speaks at a
          time, and an additional conductor is required to randomly pass the
          turn to one of the actors, who will immediately picks up where the
          story was left off and seamlessly fabricate new compatible materials
          next.<br /><br />
          There have been many questions that I’ve been asking throughout my
          semester-long investigative process of learning about comedy. I want
          to find answers as well as invite my audiences to try to explore their
          versions of answers to these questions as well: First, how does the
          American comedy landscape look like in its condensed themes and
          bare-bone identity? Secondly, how culturally relevant and
          linguistically fluent does one need to be to master the art of humor,
          to comprehend contextualized jokes, and to be considered funny?
          Thirdly, I’ve read and shared humor theories from many psychologists,
          language experts. If there are theories, summarized patterns, and
          rulebooks behind becoming a skillful comedian, with the recent NLP
          advancements, can these computational methods and studied information
          equip someone for learning the ropes? Finally, throughout my process
          of doing small-scaled procedural experiments related to text and word,
          I’ve come to the conclusion that even with the currently smartest
          natural language processing model, the generated outcome is far from
          being funny. Although people laugh when they hear generated text as
          they are unexpectedly ridiculous and beyond our ordinary imagination.
          However, does that mean there might be interesting views and opinions
          emerge from this process of human-mimic comedy simulation? Humor
          undoubtedly reflects one of the most utter intricacies of the human
          mind. Would the attempt to replicate that mind and to fathom the
          comedy law be a hilarious act in itself? In other words, is watching a
          computer struggle to be funny, funny? In terms of the form, I’d like
          to orchestra a four-player conducted story interaction for my thesis
          final presentation in April. Having multiple players, consisting of
          both bot agents with different comedy styles and a human storyteller,
          will showcase the collisions of different input information and
          chaotic harmony of machines and humans venturing to tie a story
          together. Audiences will be invited to be the conducted story player
          or the conductor of the interaction. Potentially, bot agents can
          possess an artificial voice. The content will be trained by existing
          comedy transcripts/scripts/text-based records to represent different
          comedian styles. It will be fascinating to see the contrast of output
          among female-only comedians, Americans of color comedians, cis-white
          male comedians, and other identities. When these content are delivered
          in its barebones, analyzed and learned by the generative bots, it’d be
          incredibly interesting to see audiences’ ponderings and
          takeaways.There are a couple of alternative forms that align with the
          same concept. It would also be interesting to see all human performers
          carrying out information generated by bot agents. <br /><br />The
          current stage of the execution is having one generative bot agent
          working in a conversational flow. This bot is trained with generic
          stand-up comedian transcripts that were scrapped from ScrapsoftheLoft.
          The proof of concept exists as a web application where users can type
          in any sentences. Once the input is submitted to the system, the user
          can switch the storyteller, then the interface will prompt to “please
          wait while the agent is writing something funny.” <br />

            It’s a fully-functional web-based interaction running on my local
